Problem definition:

https://hackmd.io/s/rJdSetNhM

## How it should work?

* Have an atom that maintains an app state
  `{:id 1 :name "blab" :q "hello" :timestamp 123131231}`
* Store that atom on a specific topic
  (It is a hack, but it is easy to implement the same 
   strategy but on another storage)
* Subscribe to the `:input` channel
* For every message, publish it to a channel, according to the 
  filters. 
* For new channel, create topic, add metadata, 
  store results in app state atom
* When starting up, read up an app state from the atom

### Potential problems:

* Reading from the beginning by creating a new consumer
  will pile up unuzed data in Zookeeper:
  Use `seekToBeginning` instead
